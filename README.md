🧠 The Goal was to learn about Flutter,Dart and App Development while making these projects.

# 1) Grey Counter Application using Flutter

👨🏻‍💻 I made really simple aesthetic looking Counter Application📱 using Flutter✨ which does literally what its name says.

0️⃣ It shows the count on screen of how many times the button has been pressed and there is also reset button to set counter to zero value. 

💡 P.S: I have added Drawer and Floating Action Button ( with heart Icon ) just for the aesthetics :)

🪄 I learned about Stateful Widgets through this simple Application and how we can create methods and can use setState() to rebuild the widget.
